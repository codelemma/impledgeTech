This program will read the two files input_01.txt and input_02.txt, which contain alphabetically sorted lists of words (one word per line, no spaces, all lower case). 
The program will then identify the longest compounded word and the second longest compounded word in the two files. 
The program will also print the time taken to process the two files.
